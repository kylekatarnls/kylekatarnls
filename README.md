üëã Hello there!

## Open-Source

Crossing many languages on daily basis, PHP, my first love still keeps an important place in my dev life.

That's why I contribute to librariries, frameworks and tools, mainly in this language and why I happilly continued the @briannesbitt's work on Carbon now maintaining this date library for 3 years:

If you use Symfony, Laravel, PHPMD, or Pug, then maybe you run some of my code among the thousands pieces of your vendor directory.

[‚ù§Ô∏è If you feel lucky, you can sustain my OS work sending tips via GitHub Sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/kylekatarnls)

[Or consider taking a Tidelift subscription for your company to sustain globally all the Open-Source dependencies you use](https://tidelift.com/subscription/pkg/packagist-nesbot-carbon?utm_source=packagist-nesbot-carbon&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=readme)

üôè Thank you so much to all people sustaining the Open-Source world!

## Privacy

Last topic I particularly care is privacy, that's why I believe [Proton](https://proton.me/) deserve to be known, **Proton** defends freedom on the top of a simple fundamental idea: Privacy should be the default.
