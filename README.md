üëã Hello there!

## Open-Source

Crossing many languages on daily basis, PHP, my first love still keeps an important place in my dev life.

That's why I contribute to librariries, frameworks and tools, mainly in this language and why I happilly continued the @briannesbitt's work on Carbon now maintaining this date library for 3 years:

If you use Symfony, Laravel, PHPMD, or Pug, then maybe you run some of my code among the thousands pieces of your vendor directory.

[‚ù§Ô∏è If you feel lucky, you can sustain my OS work sending tips via GitHub Sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/kylekatarnls)

[Or consider taking a Tidelift subscription for your company to sustain globally all the Open-Source dependencies you use](https://tidelift.com/subscription/pkg/packagist-nesbot-carbon?utm_source=packagist-nesbot-carbon&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=readme)

üôè Thank you so much to all people sustaining the Open-Source world!

## Recruitement

As devs, we face various kinds of recruitements, and maybe you too wanted, once or twice, to tell a recruiter: "You won't find any coders searching this way!" that's why I gave an hand to [OVNICap](https://www.ovnicap.com/) and am proud compagnies hired super devs [OVNICap](https://www.ovnicap.com/) introduced to them, and keeping regular contact with devs too, knowing they're also still happy in their workplaces keeps me motivated to help this initiative.

If you're looking for a job, we currently have [open positions mainly around Limoges üá´üá∑ and Geneva üá®üá≠ ](https://www.ovnicap.com/wall-of-fame)

## Privacy

Last topic I particularly care is privacy, that's why I beleive [ProtonVPN](https://protonvpn.com/) and [ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com/) deserve to be known, **Proton** defends freedom on the top of a simple fundamental idea: Privacy should be the default.
